    <h3><u>
      Summary 
      </u></h3>
    <p>Hi my name is Laith Suleiman and i am currently enrolled in ccsf as well as the dev mission summer cohort i would like to get my bachelors in computer science after transferring out of ccsf ,i am currently looking to enter the tech field, i intend to
      learn javascript as well as python and many other tech skills and am planning to hone in on those skills. I'm the type to look at the cup as half full never empty.my mother never raised a quitter and i don't intend to become one. i'm a go getter.
      i want something i get it,all it takes is time.im not the sharpest tool in the shed but i'll be damned if i'm not the hardworking one I've worked a construction job as well as a pizza store job with my uncles i've also volunteered at a bookstore stocking
      shelves and i have to be honest and say i'm tired of sitting around reading about the stories of better men and would like to create my own. I learned many things from those jobs dev mission such as responsibility, punctuality and a great work ethic
      dev mission has given me the tools necessary to become successful in the tech industry all i need do is use them, and o I intend too.
